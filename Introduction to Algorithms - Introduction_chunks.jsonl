What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers ? In this chapter , we will answer these questions . 1 . 1 Algorithms Informally , analgorithm is any well - deﬁned computational procedure that takes some value , or set of values , asinputand produces some value , or set of values , as output . An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output . We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well - speciﬁedcomputa - tionalproblem . The statement of the problem speciﬁes in general terms the desired input / output relationship . The algorithm describes a speciﬁc computational proce - dure for achieving that input / output relationship . For example , we might need to sort a sequence of numbers into nondecreasing order . This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools . Here is how we formally deﬁne thesortingproblem : Input : A sequence ofn numbers ha1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i . Output : A permutation ( reordering ) ha0 1 ; a 0 2 ; : : : ; a 0 n iof the input sequence such that a0 1 \u0014 a0 2 \u0014 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0014 a0 n . For example , given the input sequenceh31 ; 41 ; 59 ; 26 ; 41 ; 58 i , a sorting algorithm returns as output the sequenceh26 ; 31 ; 41 ; 41 ; 58 ; 59 i . Such an input sequence is called aninstance of the sorting problem . In general , aninstance of a problem consists of the input ( satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement ) needed to compute a solution to the problem . 6 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing Because many programs use it as an intermediate step , sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science . As a result , we have a large number of good sorting algorithms at our disposal . Which algorithm is best for a given application depends on — among other factors — the number of items to be sorted , the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted , possible restrictions on the item values , the architecture of the computer , and the kind of storage devices to be used : main memory , disks , or even tapes . An algorithm is said to becorrect if , for every input instance , it halts with the correct output . We say that a correct algorithmsolves the given computational problem . An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances , or it might halt with an incorrect answer . Contrary to what you might expect , incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful , if we can control their error rate . We shall see an example of an algorithm with a controllable error rate in Chapter 31 when we study algorithms for ﬁnding large prime numbers . Ordinarily , however , we shall be concerned only with correct algorithms . An algorithm can be speciﬁed in English , as a computer program , or even as a hardware design . The only requirement is that the speciﬁcation must provide a precise description of the computational procedure to be followed . Whatkindsofproblemsare solvedbyalgorithms ?

Sorting is by no means the only computational problem for which algorithms have been developed . ( You probably suspected as much when you saw the size of this book . ) Practical applications of algorithms are ubiquitous and include the follow - ing examples : \u000f The Human Genome Project has made great progress toward the goals of iden - tifying all the 100 , 000 genes in human DNA , determining the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA , storing this informa - tion in databases , and developing tools for data analysis . Each of these steps requires sophisticated algorithms . Although the solutions to the various prob - lems involved are beyond the scope of this book , many methods to solve these biological problems use ideas from several of the chapters in this book , thereby enabling scientists to accomplish tasks while using resources efﬁciently . The savings are in time , both human and machine , and in money , as more informa - tion can be extracted from laboratory techniques . \u000f The Internet enables people all around the world to quickly access and retrieve large amounts of information . With the aid of clever algorithms , sites on the Internet are able to manage and manipulate this large volume of data . Examples of problems that make essential use of algorithms include ﬁnding good routes on which the data will travel ( techniques for solving such problems appear in 1 . 1 Algorithms 7 Chapter 24 ) , and using a search engine to quickly ﬁnd pages on which particular information resides ( related techniques are in Chapters 11 and 32 ) . \u000f Electronic commerce enables goods and services to be negotiated and ex - changed electronically , and it depends on the privacy of personal informa - tion such as credit card numbers , passwords , and bank statements . The core technologies used in electronic commerce include public - key cryptography and digital signatures ( covered in Chapter 31 ) , which are based on numerical algo - rithms and number theory . \u000f Manufacturing and other commercial enterprises often need to allocate scarce resources in the most beneﬁcial way . An oil company may wish to know where to place its wells in order to maximize its expected proﬁt . A political candidate may want to determine where to spend money buying campaign advertising in order to maximize the chances of winning an election . An airline may wish to assign crews to ﬂights in the least expensive way possible , making sure that each ﬂight is covered and that government regulations regarding crew schedul - ing are met . An Internet service provider may wish to determine where to place additional resources in order to serve its customers more effectively . All of these are examples of problems that can be solved using linear programming , which we shall study in Chapter 29 . Although some of the details of these examples are beyond the scope of this book , we do give underlying techniques that apply to these problems and problem areas . We also show how to solve many speciﬁc problems , including the following : \u000f We are given a road map on which the distance between each pair of adjacent intersections is marked , and we", "token_count": 700}

We also show how to solve many speciﬁc problems , including the following : \u000f We are given a road map on which the distance between each pair of adjacent intersections is marked , and we wish to determine the shortest route from one intersection to another . The number of possible routes can be huge , even if we disallow routes that cross over themselves . How do we choose which of all possible routes is the shortest ? Here , we model the road map ( which is itself a model of the actual roads ) as a graph ( which we will meet in Part VI and Appendix B ) , and we wish to ﬁnd the shortest path from one vertex to another in the graph . We shall see how to solve this problem efﬁciently in Chapter 24 . \u000f We are given two ordered sequences of symbols , X Dhx1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m iand Y Dhy1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y n i , and we wish to ﬁnd a longest common subsequence of X and Y . A subsequence ofX is justX with some ( or possibly all or none ) of its elements removed . For example , one subsequence ofhA ; B ; C ; D ; E ; F ; G i would behB ; C ; E ; G i . The length of a longest common subsequence ofX and Y gives one measure of how similar these two sequences are . For example , if the two sequences are base pairs in DNA strands , then we might consider them similar if they have a long common subsequence . IfX has m symbols and Y has n symbols , then X and Y have 2m and 2n possible subsequences , 8 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing respectively . Selecting all possible subsequences ofX and Y and matching them up could take a prohibitively long time unlessm and n are very small . We shall see in Chapter 15 how to use a general technique known as dynamic programming to solve this problem much more efﬁciently . \u000f We are given a mechanical design in terms of a library of parts , where each part may include instances of other parts , and we need to list the parts in order so that each part appears before any part that uses it . If the design comprisesn parts , then there arenŠ possible orders , wherenŠ denotes the factorial function . Because the factorial function grows faster than even an exponential function , we cannot feasibly generate each possible order and then verify that , within that order , each part appears before the parts using it ( unless we have only a few parts ) . This problem is an instance of topological sorting , and we shall see in Chapter 22 how to solve this problem efﬁciently . \u000f We are givenn points in the plane , and we wish to ﬁnd the convex hull of these points . The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the points . Intuitively , we can think of each point as being represented by a nail sticking out from a board .

The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the points . Intuitively , we can think of each point as being represented by a nail sticking out from a board . The convex hull would be represented by a tight rubber band that surrounds all the nails . Each nail around which the rubber band makes a turn is a vertex of the convex hull . ( See Figure 33 . 6 on page 1029 for an example . ) Any of the2n subsets of the points might be the vertices of the convex hull . Knowing which points are vertices of the convex hull is not quite enough , either , since we also need to know the order in which they appear . There are many choices , therefore , for the vertices of the convex hull . Chapter 33 gives two good methods for ﬁnding the convex hull . These lists are far from exhaustive ( as you again have probably surmised from this book ’ s heft ) , but exhibit two characteristics that are common to many interest - ing algorithmic problems : 1 . They have many candidate solutions , the overwhelming majority of which do not solve the problem at hand . Finding one that does , or one that is “ best , ” can present quite a challenge . 2 . They have practical applications . Of the problems in the above list , ﬁnding the shortest path provides the easiest examples . A transportation ﬁrm , such as a trucking or railroad company , has a ﬁnancial interest in ﬁnding shortest paths through a road or rail network because taking shorter paths results in lower labor and fuel costs . Or a routing node on the Internet may need to ﬁnd the shortest path through the network in order to route a message quickly . Or a person wishing to drive from New York to Boston may want to ﬁnd driving directions from an appropriate Web site , or she may use her GPS while driving . 1 . 1 Algorithms 9 Not every problem solved by algorithms has an easily identiﬁed set of candidate solutions . For example , suppose we are given a set of numerical values represent - ing samples of a signal , and we want to compute the discrete Fourier transform of these samples . The discrete Fourier transform converts the time domain to the fre - quency domain , producing a set of numerical coefﬁcients , so that we can determine the strength of various frequencies in the sampled signal . In addition to lying at the heart of signal processing , discrete Fourier transforms have applications in data compression and multiplying large polynomials and integers . Chapter 30 gives an efﬁcient algorithm , the fast Fourier transform ( commonly called the FFT ) , for this problem , and the chapter also sketches out the design of a hardware circuit to compute the FFT . Datastructures This book also contains several data structures . Adata structureis a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modiﬁcations . No single data structure works well for all purposes , and so it is important to know the strengths and limitations of several of them . Technique Although you can use this book as a “ cookbook ” for algorithms , you may someday encounter a problem for which you cannot readily ﬁnd a published algorithm ( many of the exercises and problems in this book , for example ) .

This book will teach you techniques of algorithm design and analysis so that you can develop algorithms on your own , show that they give the correct answer , and understand their efﬁciency . Different chapters address different aspects of algorithmic problem solving . Some chapters address speciﬁc problems , such as ﬁnding medians and order statistics in Chapter 9 , computing minimum spanning trees in Chapter 23 , and determining a maximum ﬂow in a network in Chapter 26 . Other chapters address techniques , such as divide - and - conquer in Chapter 4 , dynamic programming in Chapter 15 , and amortized analysis in Chapter 17 . Hardproblems Most of this book is about efﬁcient algorithms . Our usual measure of efﬁciency is speed , i . e . , how long an algorithm takes to produce its result . There are some problems , however , for which no efﬁcient solution is known . Chapter 34 studies an interesting subset of these problems , which are known as NP - complete . Why are NP - complete problems interesting ? First , although no efﬁcient algo - rithm for an NP - complete problem has ever been found , nobody has ever proven 10 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing that an efﬁcient algorithm for one cannot exist . In other words , no one knows whether or not efﬁcient algorithms exist for NP - complete problems . Second , the set of NP - complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efﬁcient algo - rithm exists for any one of them , then efﬁcient algorithms exist for all of them . This relationship among the NP - complete problems makes the lack of efﬁcient solutions all the more tantalizing . Third , several NP - complete problems are similar , but not identical , to problems for which we do know of efﬁcient algorithms . Computer scientists are intrigued by how a small change to the problem statement can cause a big change to the efﬁciency of the best known algorithm . You should know about NP - complete problems because some of them arise sur - prisingly often in real applications . If you are called upon to produce an efﬁcient algorithm for an NP - complete problem , you are likely to spend a lot of time in a fruitless search . If you can show that the problem is NP - complete , you can instead spend your time developing an efﬁcient algorithm that gives a good , but not the best possible , solution . As a concrete example , consider a delivery company with a central depot . Each day , it loads up each delivery truck at the depot and sends it around to deliver goods to several addresses . At the end of the day , each truck must end up back at the depot so that it is ready to be loaded for the next day . To reduce costs , the company wants to select an order of delivery stops that yields the lowest overall distance traveled by each truck . This problem is the well - known “ traveling - salesman problem , ” and it is NP - complete . It has no known efﬁcient algorithm . Under certain assumptions , however , we know of efﬁcient algorithms that give", "token_count": 700}

This problem is the well - known “ traveling - salesman problem , ” and it is NP - complete . It has no known efﬁcient algorithm . Under certain assumptions , however , we know of efﬁcient algorithms that give an overall distance which is not too far above the smallest possible . Chapter 35 discusses such “ approximation algorithms . ” Parallelism For many years , we could count on processor clock speeds increasing at a steady rate . Physical limitations present a fundamental roadblock to ever - increasing clock speeds , however : because power density increases superlinearly with clock speed , chips run the risk of melting once their clock speeds become high enough . In order to perform more computations per second , therefore , chips are being designed to contain not just one but several processing “ cores . ” We can liken these multicore computers to several sequential computers on a single chip ; in other words , they are a type of “ parallel computer . ” In order to elicit the best performance from multicore computers , we need to design algorithms with parallelism in mind . Chapter 27 presents a model for “ multithreaded ” algorithms , which take advantage of multiple cores . This model has advantages from a theoretical standpoint , and it forms the basis of several successful computer programs , including a championship chess program . 1 . 2 Algorithms as a technology 11 Exercises 1 . 1 - 1 Give a real - world example that requires sorting or a real - world example that re - quires computing a convex hull . 1 . 1 - 2 Other than speed , what other measures of efﬁciency might one use in a real - world setting ? 1 . 1 - 3 Select a data structure that you have seen previously , and discuss its strengths and limitations . 1 . 1 - 4 How are the shortest - path and traveling - salesman problems given above similar ? How are they different ? 1 . 1 - 5 Come up with a real - world problem in which only the best solution will do . Then come up with one in which a solution that is “ approximately ” the best is good enough . 1 . 2 Algorithmsasatechnology Suppose computers were inﬁnitely fast and computer memory was free . Would you have any reason to study algorithms ? The answer is yes , if for no other reason than that you would still like to demonstrate that your solution method terminates and does so with the correct answer . If computers were inﬁnitely fast , any correct method for solving a problem would do . You would probably want your implementation to be within the bounds of good software engineering practice ( for example , your implementation should be well designed and documented ) , but you would most often use whichever method was the easiest to implement . Of course , computers may be fast , but they are not inﬁnitely fast . And memory may be inexpensive , but it is not free . Computing time is therefore a bounded resource , and so is space in memory . You should use these resources wisely , and algorithms that are efﬁcient in terms of time or space will help you do so . 12 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing Efﬁciency Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often", "token_count": 700}

You should use these resources wisely , and algorithms that are efﬁcient in terms of time or space will help you do so . 12 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing Efﬁciency Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efﬁciency . These differences can be much more signiﬁcant than differences due to hardware and software . As an example , in Chapter 2 , we will see two algorithms for sorting . The ﬁrst , known asinsertionsort , takes time roughly equal toc1n2 to sortn items , wherec1 is a constant that does not depend onn . That is , it takes time roughly proportional to n2 . The second , merge sort , takes time roughly equal toc2n lg n , where lgn stands for log2 n and c2 is another constant that also does not depend onn . Inser - tion sort typically has a smaller constant factor than merge sort , so thatc1 < c 2 . We shall see that the constant factors can have far less of an impact on the running time than the dependence on the input sizen . Let ’ s write insertion sort ’ s running time asc1n \u0001 n and merge sort ’ s running time asc2n \u0001 lg n . Then we see that where insertion sort has a factor ofn in its running time , merge sort has a factor of lgn , which is much smaller . ( For example , whenn D1000 , lgn is approximately10 , and whenn equals one million , lgn is approximately only20 . ) Although insertion sort usually runs faster than merge sort for small input sizes , once the input sizen becomes large enough , merge sort ’ s advantage of lgn vs . n will more than com - pensate for the difference in constant factors . No matter how much smallerc1 is than c2 , there will always be a crossover point beyond which merge sort is faster . For a concrete example , let us pit a faster computer ( computer A ) running inser - tion sort against a slower computer ( computer B ) running merge sort . They each must sort an array of 10 million numbers . ( Although 10 million numbers might seem like a lot , if the numbers are eight - byte integers , then the input occupies about 80 megabytes , which ﬁts in the memory of even an inexpensive laptop com - puter many times over . ) Suppose that computer A executes 10 billion instructions per second ( faster than any single sequential computer at the time of this writing ) and computer B executes only 10 million instructions per second , so that com - puter A is 1000 times faster than computer B in raw computing power . To make the difference even more dramatic , suppose that the world ’ s craftiest programmer codes insertion sort in machine language for computer A , and the resulting code requires 2n2 instructions to sortn numbers . Suppose further that just an average programmer implements merge sort , using a high - level language with an inefﬁcient compiler , with the resulting code taking50n lg n instructions . To sort 10 million numbers , computer A takes 2 \u0001 . 107 / 2 instructions 1010 instructions / second", "token_count": 700}

The advan - tage of merge sort is even more pronounced when we sort 100 million numbers : where insertion sort takes more than 23 days , merge sort takes under four hours . In general , as the problem size increases , so does the relative advantage of merge sort . Algorithmsandothertechnologies The example above shows that we should consider algorithms , like computer hard - ware , as atechnology . Total system performance depends on choosing efﬁcient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware . Just as rapid advances are being made in other computer technologies , they are being made in algorithms as well . You might wonder whether algorithms are truly that important on contemporary computers in light of other advanced technologies , such as \u000f advanced computer architectures and fabrication technologies , \u000f easy - to - use , intuitive , graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) , \u000f object - oriented systems , \u000f integrated Web technologies , and \u000f fast networking , both wired and wireless . The answer is yes . Although some applications do not explicitly require algorith - mic content at the application level ( such as some simple , Web - based applications ) , many do . For example , consider a Web - based service that determines how to travel from one location to another . Its implementation would rely on fast hardware , a graphical user interface , wide - area networking , and also possibly on object ori - entation . However , it would also require algorithms for certain operations , such as ﬁnding routes ( probably using a shortest - path algorithm ) , rendering maps , and interpolating addresses . Moreover , even an application that does not require algorithmic content at the application level relies heavily upon algorithms . Does the application rely on fast hardware ? The hardware design used algorithms . Does the application rely on graphical user interfaces ? The design of any GUI relies on algorithms . Does the application rely on networking ? Routing in networks relies heavily on algorithms . Was the application written in a language other than machine code ? Then it was processed by a compiler , interpreter , or assembler , all of which make extensive use 14 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing of algorithms .
