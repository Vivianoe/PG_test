A salt marsh in the Chesapeake Bay on the East Coast of the United States contains an assortment of organismsthat interact with one another and are interdependent in a variety of ways . This bay is an estuary , a semi ‐ enclosed body of water found where fresh water from a river drains into the ocean . Estuaries , which are complexsystems under the influence of tides , gradually change from unsalty fresh water to salty ocean water . In theChesapeake Bay , this change results in freshwater marshes at the head of the bay , brackish ( moderately salty ) marshes in the middle bay region , and salt marshes on the ocean side of the bay . The salt marsh consists of flooded meadows of cordgrass ( see photograph ) . Few other plants are capable ofsurviving the high salinity and tidal inundations characteristic of the challenging environment . Both cordgrassand microscopic algae ( photosynthetic aquatic organisms ) are eaten directly by some animals , and when they die , their remains provide food for other salt marsh inhabitants . Insects , particularly mosquitoes and horseflies , number in the millions . Birds nesting in the salt marsh includeseaside sparrows , laughing gulls , and clapper rails . Large numbers of invertebrates , such as shrimp , crabs , worms , and clams , seek refuge in the water surrounding the cordgrass . Here they eat , hide from predators , andreproduce . Chesapeake Bay marshes are an important nursery for numerous marine fishes — spotted sea trout , Atlanticcroaker , and bluefish , to name just a few . The young of these species grow into juveniles in the estuary . Almost noamphibians inhabit salt marshes — the salty water dries out their skin — but a few reptiles , such as the northerndiamondback terrapin and northern water snake , have adapted . The meadow vole , a small rodent and excellentswimmer , scampers about the salt marsh day and night . It eats mainly insects and cordgrass . These visible plants and animals , as well as the unseen microscopic world — countless algae , protozoa , fungi , andbacteria — face significant environmental challenges , all of which together highlight the complexity of a salt marshecosystem .

Distinguish among the following ecological levels : population , community , ecosystem , landscape , andbiosphere . Ernst Haeckel , a 19th ‐ century scientist , developed the concept of ecology and named it — eco from the Greekword for “ house ” and logy from the Greek word for “ study . ” Thus , ecology literally means “ the study of one ' shouse . ” The environment — one ' s house — consists of two parts , the biotic ( living ) environment , which includes allorganisms , and the abiotic ( nonliving , or physical", "token_count": 700}

Ernst Haeckel , a 19th ‐ century scientist , developed the concept of ecology and named it — eco from the Greekword for “ house ” and logy from the Greek word for “ study . ” Thus , ecology literally means “ the study of one ' shouse . ” The environment — one ' s house — consists of two parts , the biotic ( living ) environment , which includes allorganisms , and the abiotic ( nonliving , or physical ) surroundings , which include living space , temperature , sunlight , soil , wind , and precipitation ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . FIGURE 3 . 1 Some abiotic and biotic components of a Chesapeake Bay salt marshShown is a mudflat at low tide . Abiotic ( nonliving ) components are labeled in yellow and biotic ( living ) components , in green .

The focus of ecology is local or global , specific or generalized , depending on what questions the scientist is tryingto answer . One ecologist might determine the temperature or light requirements of a single oak species in aforest , another might study all the organisms that live in that forest , and yet another might examine hownutrients flow between the forest and surrounding areas . Ecology is the broadest field within the biological sciences , and it is linked to every other biological discipline . The universality of ecology links subjects that are not traditionally part of biology . Geology and earth science areextremely important to ecology , especially when ecologists examine the physical environment of planet Earth . Chemistry and physics are also important ; in this chapter , for example , knowledge of chemistry is necessary tounderstand photosynthesis , and principles of physics illuminate the laws of thermodynamics . Humans arebiological organisms , and our activities have a bearing on ecology . Even economics and politics have profoundecological implications , as was discussed in Chapter 2 . How does the field of ecology fit into the organization of the biological world ? Ecologists are most interested inthe levels of biological organization that include or are above the level of the individual organism ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . Individuals of the same species occur in populations . A population ecologist might study a population of polarbears or a population of marsh grass . Population ecology is discussed in Chapter 5 , and human populations inChapters 8 and 9 . Species are considered further in Chapter 16 . FIGURE 3 . 2 Levels of ecological organization Ecologists study the levels of biological organization from individual organisms to the biosphere .

Question At what level of organization might an ecologist study how a growing population of a snakespecies introduced to a marsh ecosystem is affecting populations of small rodents there ? Populations are organized into communities . Ecologists characterize communities by the number and kinds ofspecies that live there , along with their relationships with one another . A community ecologist might study howorganisms interact with one another — including feeding relationships ( who eats whom ) — in an alpine meadowcommunity or in a coral reef community ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . FIGURE 3 . 3 Coral reef community Coral reef communities have the greatest number of species and are the most complex aquatic community . Thisclose ‐ up of a coral reef in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Mexico shows a green moray eel , French grunts , andseveral species of coral . Today many coral reefs worldwide are threatened by global climate change . Question What is the most likely direct effect of climate change on coral reefs ? Ecosystem is a more inclusive term than community . An ecosystem includes all the biotic interactions of acommunity , as well as the interactions between organisms and their abiotic environment . Like other systems , anecosystem consists of multiple interacting and inseparable parts and processes that form a unified whole . Anecosystem — whether terrestrial or aquatic — is a system in which all the biological , physical , and chemicalcomponents of an area form a complex , interacting network of energy flow and materials cycling . An ecosystemecologist might examine how energy , nutrients , organic ( carbon ‐ containing ) materials , and water affect theorganisms living in a desert ecosystem , a forest , or a coastal bay ecosystem . The ultimate goal of ecosystem ecologists is to understand how ecosystems function . This is not a simple task , butit is important because ecosystem processes collectively regulate the global cycles of water , carbon , nitrogen , phosphorus , and sulfur essential to the survival of humans and all other organisms . As humans increasingly alterecosystems for their own uses , the natural functioning of ecosystems is changed , and we must determine whetherthese changes will affect the sustainability of our life ‐ support system . Landscape ecology is a subdiscipline of ecology that studies ecological processes operating over large areas . Landscape ecologists examine the connections among ecosystems found in a particular region . Consider a simplelandscape consisting of a forest ecosystem located adjacent to a pond ecosystem . One connection between thesetwo ecosystems might be great blue herons , which eat fishes , frogs , insects , crustaceans , and snakes along theshallow water of the pond but often build nests and raise their young in the secluded treetops of the nearbyforest . Landscapes , then , are based on larger land areas that include several ecosystems . The organisms of the biosphere — Earth ' s communities , ecosystems , and landscapes — depend on one anotherand on the other realms of Earth ' s physical environment : the atmosphere , hydrosphere , and lithosphere ( Figure3 . 4 ) .

The Energy of Life LEARNING OBJECTIVES Define energy , explaining how it is related to work and to heat . Contrast potential energy and kinetic energy . Distinguish between open and closed systems . State the first and second laws of thermodynamics , discussing the implications of these laws as theyrelate to organisms . Summarize the reactions for photosynthesis and cellular respiration , contrasting these two biologicalprocesses . Energy is the capacity or ability to do work . In organisms , any biological work — such as growing , moving , reproducing , and maintaining and repairing damaged tissues — requires energy . Energy exists in several forms : chemical , radiant , thermal , mechanical , nuclear , and electrical . Chemical energy is energy stored in the bonds ofmolecules ; for example , food contains chemical energy , and organisms use the energy released when chemicalbonds are broken and new bonds form . Radiant energy is energy , such as radio waves , visible light , and X ‐ rays , that is transmitted as electromagnetic waves ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Solar energy is radiant energy from the sun ; itincludes ultraviolet radiation , visible light , and infrared radiation . Thermal energy is heat that flows from anobject with a higher temperature ( the heat source ) to an object with a lower temperature ( the heat sink ) . Mechanical energy is energy involved in the movement of matter . Some of the matter contained in atomic nucleican be converted into nuclear energy . Electrical energy is energy that flows as charged particles . You willencounter these forms of energy throughout the text . c . community . d . population . e . family . 2 .

FIGURE 3 . 5 The electromagnetic spectrumThe shortest wavelengths are gamma rays , and the longest are TV and radio waves . Visible light occurs betweenultraviolet and infrared radiation . Biologists generally express energy in units of work ( kilojoules , kJ ) or units of heat ( kilocalories , kcal ) . Onekilocalorie is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 ° C , equal to 4 . 184 kJ . The kcal isthe unit that nutritionists use to express the energy content of the foods we eat . Energy can exist as stored energy , called potential energy , or as kinetic energy , the energy of motion . Thinkof potential energy as an arrow on a drawn bow , which equals the work the archer did when drawing the bow toits position ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . When the string is released , the bow ' s potential energy is converted to the arrow ' skinetic energy of motion . Similarly , the cordgrass that a meadow vole eats has chemical potential energy in thebonds of its molecules . As molecular bonds in the cordgrass are broken by cellular respiration , this energy isconverted to kinetic energy and heat as the meadow vole swims in the salt marsh . Thus , energy changes from oneform to another . FIGURE 3 . 6 Potential and kinetic energyPotential energy is stored in the drawn bow ( shown ) and is converted to kinetic energy as the arrow speedstoward its target . Photographed at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . The study of energy and its transformations is called thermodynamics . When considering thermodynamics , scientists use the word system to refer to a group of atoms , molecules , or objects being studied . 1 The rest of theuniverse other than the system is known as the surroundings . A closed system is self ‐ contained ; that is , it doesnot exchange energy with its surroundings ( Figure 3 . 7 ) . 2 Closed systems are very rare in nature . In contrast , anopen system exchanges energy with its surroundings . This text discusses many kinds of open systems . Forexample , a city is an open system with an input of energy ( as well as food , water , and consumer goods ) . Outputs from a city system include energy ( as well as manufactured goods , sewage , and solid waste ) . On a global scale , Earth is an open system dependent on a continual supply of energy from the sun . FIGURE 3 . 7 Closed and open systems , with regard to energy . Regardless of whether a system is open or closed , two laws about energy apply to all things in the universe : thefirst and second laws of thermodynamics .

The First Law of Thermodynamics According to the first law of thermodynamics , an organism may absorb energy from its surroundings , or itmay give up some energy into its surroundings , but the total energy content of the organism and its surroundingsis always the same . As far as we know , the energy present in the universe at its formation , approximately 15 – 20billion years ago , equals the amount of energy present in the universe today . This is all the energy that will everbe present in the universe . Similarly , the energy of any system and its surroundings is constant . A system mayabsorb energy from its surroundings , or it may give up some energy into its surroundings , but the total energycontent of that system and its surroundings is always the same . The first law of thermodynamics specifies that an organism cannot create the energy it requires to live . Instead , itmust capture energy from the environment to use for biological work , a process involving the transformation ofenergy from one form to another . In photosynthesis , plants absorb the radiant energy of the sun and convert itinto the chemical energy contained in the bonds of carbohydrate ( sugar ) molecules . Similarly , some of thatchemical energy may later be transformed by an animal that eats the plant into the mechanical energy of musclecontraction , enabling the animal to walk , run , jump , slither , fly , or swim . The Second Law of Thermodynamics As each energy transformation occurs , some energy is changed to heat that is released into the coolersurroundings . No other organism can ever reuse this energy for biological work ; it is “ lost ” from the biologicalpoint of view . It is not really gone from a thermodynamic point of view because it still exists in the surroundingphysical environment . Similarly , the use of food to enable us to walk or run does not destroy the chemical energyonce present in the food molecules . After we have performed the task of walking or running , the energy stillexists in the surroundings as heat . According to the second law of thermodynamics , the amount of usable energy available to do work in theuniverse decreases over time . The second law of thermodynamics is consistent with the first law ; that is , the totalamount of energy in the universe is not decreasing with time . However , the total amount of energy in theuniverse available to do work decreases over time . Less ‐ usable energy is more diffuse , or disorganized . Entropy is a measure of this disorder or randomness ; organized , usable energy has low entropy , whereas disorganized energy such as heat has high entropy . Entropy iscontinuously increasing in the universe in all natural processes , and entropy is not reversible . Another way toexplain the second law of thermodynamics , then , is that entropy , or disorder , in a system increases over time . An implication of the second law of thermodynamics is that no process requiring an energy conversion is ever100 % efficient because much of the energy is dispersed as heat , resulting in an increase in entropy . ( Efficiency inthis context refers to the amount of useful work produced per total energy input . ) An automobile engine , which converts the chemical energy of gasoline to mechanical energy , is between 20 % and 30 % efficient . That is , only20 % to 30 % of the original energy stored in the chemical bonds of the", "token_count": 700}

( Efficiency inthis context refers to the amount of useful work produced per total energy input . ) An automobile engine , which converts the chemical energy of gasoline to mechanical energy , is between 20 % and 30 % efficient . That is , only20 % to 30 % of the original energy stored in the chemical bonds of the gasoline molecules is actually transformedinto mechanical energy , or work . In our cells , energy use for metabolism is about 40 % efficient , with theremaining energy given to the surroundings as heat . Organisms are highly organized , which at first glance might appear inconsistent with the second law ofthermodynamics . As organisms grow and develop , they maintain a high level of order and do not become moredisorganized . However , organisms maintain their degree of order over time only with the constant input ofenergy . That is why plants must photosynthesize and why animals must eat food . When relating the second lawof thermodynamics to living organisms , the organisms ' surroundings must also be considered . Throughout itslife , as a plant takes in solar energy and photosynthesizes , it continually breaks down the products ofphotosynthesis to supply its own energy needs . This breakdown releases heat into the environment . Similarly , asan animal eats and processes food to meet its energy needs , it releases heat into the surroundings . When anorganism and its surroundings are taken into account , both laws of thermodynamics are satisfied . Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration Environmental Science Basics : Photosynthesis Energy is stored in living things as carbon compounds . Photosynthesis is the biological process in which lightenergy from the sun is captured and transformed into the chemical energy of carbohydrate ( sugar ) molecules ( Interactive Figure 3 . 8 ) . Photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll , which gives plants their green color , absorb radiant energy . This energy is used to manufacture the carbohydrate glucose ( C6H12O6 ) from carbondioxide ( CO2 ) and water ( H2O ) , a process that also releases oxygen ( O2 ) .

You may close thelabels by clicking on the “ X . ” Interactive Figure 3 . 8 Photosynthesis and cellular respiration make up a system These processes occur continuously in the cells of living organisms . Note that energy flow is not cyclic ; energyenters living organisms as radiant energy and leaves organisms for the surroundings as heat energy . Question Given that increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are linked to climate warming , whichprocess — photosynthesis or cellular respiration — could help reduce warming if it was increasedsignificantly ? Explain your answer . The chemical equation for photosynthesis is read as follows : 6 molecules of carbon dioxide plus 12 molecules ofwater plus light energy are used to produce 1 molecule of glucose plus 6 molecules of water plus 6 molecules ofoxygen .

( See Case inPoint : Life Without the Sun for a discussion of an alternative to photosynthesis that is found in extremeenvironments . ) Photosynthesis provides these organisms with a ready supply of energy in carbohydratemolecules , which they use as the need arises . The energy can also be transferred from one organism to another — for example , from plants to the organisms that eat plants . Oxygen , which many organisms require when theybreak down glucose or similar foods to obtain energy , is a byproduct of photosynthesis . Case in Point | Life Without the Sun The sun is the energy source for almost all ecosystems . A notable exception was discovered in the late 1970sin a series of deep ‐ sea hydrothermal vents in the Eastern Pacific where seawater had penetrated andbeen heated by the radioactive rocks below . During its time within Earth , the water had been charged withinorganic compounds , including hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) . Although no light is available for photosynthesis there , hydrothermal vents support a rich ecosystem thatcontrasts with the surrounding “ desert ” of the deep ‐ ocean floor . Giant , blood ‐ red tube worms almost 3 m ( 10 ft ) in length cluster in great numbers around the vents ( Figure 3 . 9 ) . Other animals around thehydrothermal vents include shrimp , crabs , clams , barnacles , and mussels . FIGURE 3 . 9 Hydrothermal vent ecosystem Bacteria living in the tissues of these tube worms extract energy from hydrogen sulfide to manufactureorganic compounds . These worms lack digestive systems and depend on the organic compounds thebacteria provide , along with materials filtered from the surrounding water . Scientists initially wondered what the ultimate source of energy is for the species in this dark environment . Most deep ‐ sea ecosystems depend on the organic material that drifts down from surface waters ; that is , they depend on energy derived from photosynthesis . But hydrothermal vent ecosystems , now known toexist in hundreds of places , are too densely clustered and too productive to depend on chance encounterswith organic material from surface waters . The base of the food web in these aquatic oases consists of certain bacteria that survive and multiply inwater so hot ( exceeding 200 ° C , or 392 ° F ) that it would not remain in liquid form were it not under suchextreme pressure . These bacteria function as producers , but they do not photosynthesize . Instead , theyobtain energy and make carbohydrate molecules from inorganic raw materials by carrying outchemosynthesis . Chemosynthetic bacteria possess enzymes ( organic catalysts ) that cause the inorganicmolecule hydrogen sulfide to react with oxygen , producing water and sulfur or sulfate . Such chemicalreactions provide the energy to support these bacteria and other organisms in deep ‐ ocean hydrothermalvents . Many of the vent animals consume the bacteria directly by filter feeding . Others , such as the gianttube worms , obtain energy from chemosynthetic bacteria that live symbiotically inside their bodies . Not all chemosynthesis takes place in the deep ocean .

Chemosynthetic bacteria also thrive in hot springsthat reach Earth ' s surface , including well ‐ visited ones in Yellowstone National Park , in cave water , deep inpolar ice , in volcanoes , and in other locations where photosynthesis cannot occur . The chemical energy that plants store in carbohydrates and other molecules is released within the cells of plants , animals , or other organisms through cellular respiration . In aerobic cellular respiration , molecules such asglucose are broken down in the presence of oxygen and water into carbon dioxide and water , with the release ofenergy ( see Figure 3 . 8 ) . Aerobic cellular respiration : Cellular respiration makes the chemical energy stored in glucose and other food molecules available to the cellfor biological work , such as moving around , courting , and growing new cells and tissues . All organisms , includinggreen plants , respire to obtain energy . Some organisms do not use oxygen for this process .

An organism cannot create the energy it requires to live ; it mustcapture energy from the environment to use for biological work . True False plants . All organisms — plants , animals , and microorganisms — respire to obtain some of the energy in organicmolecules . When cellular respiration breaks these molecules apart , the energy becomes available for work suchas repairing tissues , producing body heat , or reproducing . As the work is accomplished , the energy escapes theorganism and dissipates into the environment as heat ( recall the second law of thermodynamics ) . Ultimately , thisheat radiates into space . Once an organism has used energy , that energy becomes unusable for all otherorganisms . The movement of energy just described is called energy flow . Producers , Consumers , and Decomposers The organisms of an ecosystem are divided into three categories on the basis of how they obtain nourishment : producers , consumers , and decomposers ( Interactive Figure 3 . 10 ) . Virtually all ecosystems containrepresentatives of all three groups , which interact extensively , both directly and indirectly , with one another . B e g i n Directions : Click on each number in the sequence to progress through the graphic . 1 Interactive Figure 3 . 10 Energy flow among producers , consumers , and decomposersIn photosynthesis , producers use the energy from sunlight to make organic molecules . Consumers obtain energywhen they eat producers or other consumers . Decomposers , such as bacteria and fungi , obtain energy fromwastes and dead organic material from producers and consumers . During every energy transaction , some energyis lost to biological systems as it disperses into the environment as heat . QuestionWhich group of organisms obtains energy from all other types of organisms in the ecosystem ? Producers , also called autotrophs ( Greek auto , “ self , ” and tropho , “ nourishment ” ) , manufacture organicmolecules from simple inorganic substances , generally CO2 and water , usually using the energy of sunlight . Inother words , most producers perform the process of photosynthesis . Producers incorporate the chemicals theymanufacture into their own bodies , becoming potential food resources for other organisms . Whereas plants arethe most significant producers on land , algae and certain types of bacteria are important producers in aquaticenvironments . In the salt marsh ecosystem discussed in the chapter introduction , cordgrass , algae , andphotosynthetic bacteria are important producers .

Animals are consumers ; they obtain energy as well as bodybuilding material by eating other organisms . Consumers are also called heterotrophs ( Greek heter , “ different , ” and tropho , “ nourishment ” ) . Consumers thateat producers are primary consumers or herbivores ( plant eaters ) . Rabbits and deer are examples ofprimary consumers , as is the marsh periwinkle , a type of snail that feeds on algae in the salt marsh ecosystem . Secondary consumers eat primary consumers , whereas tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers — amouse eats plants , a snake eats the mouse , a hawk eats the snake . Both secondary and tertiary consumers are flesh ‐ eating carnivores that eat other animals . Lions , lizards , and spiders are examples of carnivores , as are thenorthern diamondback terrapin and the northern water snake in the salt marsh ecosystem . Other consumers , called omnivores , eat a variety of organisms , both plant and animal . Bears , pigs , and humans are examples ofomnivores ; the meadow vole , which eats both insects and cordgrass in the salt marsh ecosystem , is also anomnivore . Some consumers , called detritus feeders or detritivores , consume detritus , organic matter that includesanimal carcasses , leaf litter , and feces . Detritus feeders , such as snails , crabs , clams , and worms , are especiallyabundant in aquatic environments , where they burrow in the bottom muck and consume the organic matter thatcollects there . Marsh crabs are detritus feeders in the salt marsh ecosystem . Earthworms , termites , beetles , snails , and millipedes are terrestrial ( land ‐ dwelling ) detritus feeders . An earthworm actually eats its way throughthe soil , digesting much of the organic matter contained there . Detritus feeders work with microbial decomposersto destroy dead organisms and waste products . Decomposers , also called saprotrophs ( Greek sapro , “ rotten , ” and tropho , “ nourishment ” ) , are heterotrophsthat break down dead organic material and use the decomposition products to supply themselves with energy . They typically release simple inorganic molecules ( e . g . , CO2 ) and mineral salts that producers can reuse . Bacteriaand fungi are important decomposers . For example , during the decomposition of dead wood , sugar ‐ metabolizingfungi first invade the wood and consume simple carbohydrates , such as glucose and maltose . When thesecarbohydrates are exhausted , other fungi , often aided by termites with symbiotic bacteria in their guts , completethe digestion of the wood by breaking down cellulose , the main carbohydrate of wood .

Without microbial decomposers , important elements such aspotassium , nitrogen , and phosphorus would remain permanently trapped in dead organisms , unavailable for newgenerations of organisms . The Path of Energy Flow : Who Eats Whom in Ecosystems Environmental Science Basics : Trophic Levels In an ecosystem , energy flow occurs in food chains , in which energy from food passes from one organism to thenext in a sequence ( see Figure 3 . 10 ) . Each level , or “ link , ” in a food chain is a trophic level ( recall that the Greektropho means “ nourishment ” ) . An organism is assigned a trophic level based on the number of energy transfersteps from the source of energy to that level . Producers ( organisms that photosynthesize ) form the first trophiclevel , primary consumers ( herbivores ) the second trophic level , secondary consumers ( carnivores ) the thirdtrophic level , and so on . At every step in a food chain are decomposers , which respire organic molecules from thecarcasses and body wastes of all members of the food chain . Simple food chains rarely occur in nature because few organisms eat just one kind of organism . More typically , the flow of energy and materials through an ecosystem takes place in accordance with a range of food choices foreach organism involved . In an ecosystem of average complexity , numerous alternative pathways are possible . Ahawk eating a rabbit is a different energy pathway than a hawk eating a snake . A food web is a more realisticmodel of the flow of energy and materials through an ecosystem ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . A food web helps us visualizefeeding relationships that indicate how a community is organized . FIGURE 3 . 11 Food web at the edge of an eastern deciduous forest This food web is greatly simplified compared to what actually happens in nature . Groups of species are lumpedinto single categories such as “ spiders ” and “ fungi , ” other species are not included , and many links in the web arenot shown . Question What organisms and links could you add to this food web ? The most important thing to remember about energy flow in ecosystems is that it is linear , or one way . Energymoves along a food chain or food web from one organism to the next as long as it has not been used for biologicalwork . Once an organism has used energy , that energy is lost as heat and is unavailable for any other organism inthe ecosystem . Case in Point | How Humans Have Affected the Antarctic Food Web Although the icy waters around Antarctica may seem an inhospitable environment , a complex food web isfound there .

The base of the food web consists of microscopic , photosynthetic algae present in vastnumbers in the well ‐ lit , nutrient ‐ rich water . A huge population of herbivores — tiny , shrimplike krill — eatthese marine algae ( Figure 3 . 12a ) . Krill , in turn , support a variety of larger animals . A major consumer ofkrill is the baleen whale , which filters krill out of the frigid water . Baleen whales around Antarctica includeblue whales , right whales , minke whales , and humpback whales ( Figure 3 . 12b ) . Squid and fishes alsoconsume krill in great quantities . These animals , in turn , are eaten by other carnivores : toothed whalessuch as the sperm whale , elephant seals and leopard seals , king penguins and emperor penguins , and birdssuch as the albatross and the petrel . FIGURE 3 . 12 Antarctic food web . Humans have had an impact on the Antarctic food web , as they have had on most other ecosystems . Beforethe advent of whaling , baleen whales consumed huge quantities of krill . Until a global ban on hunting largewhales was enacted in 1986 , whaling steadily reduced the number of large baleen whales in Antarcticwaters . As a result of fewer whales eating krill , more krill became available for other krill ‐ eating animals , yet krill populations are thought to have been limited in part by the lack of nutrients provided in the wastesof baleen whales . Now that commercial whaling is regulated , some species of baleen whales , including humpback whales , appear to be increasing in number . Minke whales , however , are declining rapidly ; estimated at 40 percentof whales along the Antarctic Peninsula in the early 2000s , in 2016 they accounted for approximately 5 percent . Early investigations suggest that the minke whale ' s preference for feeding under sea ice — where thesmaller whale species is sheltered from predators — may be the cause of its decline , as sea ice is steadilyvanishing . Disappearing sea ice is attributable to another human ‐ induced effect , global climate change . As thewater has warmed in recent decades around Antarctica , less pack ice has formed in many areas duringwinter months , and the summer ice ‐ free period has increased . Large numbers of marine algae are found inand around the pack ice , providing a critical supply of food for the krill , which reproduce in the area . Yearswith below ‐ average pack ice cover mean fewer algae , which mean fewer krill reproducing . Declining krillpopulations would eventually affect all baleen whale species , including those still recovering from whalingeffects . Researchers are also finding direct damage to krill from ocean acidification associated with the warmingtemperatures . Scientists have demonstrated that low krill abundance coincides with unsuccessful breedingseasons for penguins and fur seals , which struggle to find food during warmer winters . Scientists areconcerned that climate change will continue to decrease the amount of pack ice and increase oceanacidification , which will reverberate through the food web .

( Global climate change , including the effect onAdélie penguins in Antarctica , is discussed in Chapter 20 . ) Past thinning of the ozone layer in the stratospheric region of the atmosphere over Antarctica is anotherhuman influence that may have contributed to effects on the entire Antarctic food web . Ozone thinningallows more of the sun ' s ultraviolet radiation to penetrate to Earth ' s surface . Ultraviolet radiation containsmore energy than visible light and can break the chemical bonds of some biologically important molecules , such as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . Scientists are concerned that damage to the algae that form the baseof the food web in the Southern Ocean , and their declining numbers , may be caused by increased ultravioletradiation associated with ozone thinning over Antarctica , as well as by rising sea temperatures . ( Theproblem of stratospheric ozone depletion is discussed in detail in Chapter 19 . ) To complicate stresses on the Antarctic food web , some commercial fishermen have started to harvest krillto make fishmeal for aquaculture industries ( discussed in Chapter 18 ) . Scientists worry that the humanharvest of krill may further endanger the many marine animals that depend on krill for food . Video : Arctic Food Webs Ecological Pyramids An important feature of energy flow is that most of the energy going from one trophic level to the next in a foodchain or food web dissipates into the environment as a result of the second law of thermodynamics . Ecologicalpyramids often graphically represent the relative energy values of each trophic level . There are three main typesof pyramids — a pyramid of numbers , a pyramid of biomass , and a pyramid of energy . A pyramid of numbers shows the number of organisms at each trophic level in a given ecosystem , with greaternumbers illustrated by a larger area for that section of the pyramid ( Figure 3 . 13 ) . In most pyramids of numbers , the organisms at the base of the food chain are the most abundant , and fewer organisms occupy each successivetrophic level . In the Antarctic food web , for example , the number of algae is far greater than the number of krillthat feed on the algae ; likewise , the number of krill is greater than the number of baleen whales , squid , and fishesthat feed on krill . FIGURE 3 . 13 Pyramid of numbers This pyramid is for a hypothetical area of temperate grassland ; in this example , 10 , 000 grass plants support 10mice , which support one bird of prey . Based on the number of organisms found at each trophic level , a pyramidof numbers is not as useful as other ecological pyramids .

( Note that decomposers are not shown . ) Inverted pyramids of numbers , in which higher trophic levels have more organisms than lower trophic levels , areoften observed among decomposers , parasites , tree ‐ dwelling herbivorous insects , and similar organisms . Onetree may provide food for thousands of leaf ‐ eating insects , for example . Pyramids of numbers are of limitedusefulness because they do not indicate the biomass of the organisms at each level , and they do not indicate theamount of energy transferred from one level to another . A pyramid of biomass illustrates the total biomass at each successive trophic level in an ecosystem . Biomassis a quantitative estimate of the total mass , or amount , of living material ; it indicates the amount of fixed energyat a particular time . Biomass units of measure vary : Biomass is represented as total volume , as dry weight , or aslive weight . Typically , pyramids of biomass illustrate a progressive reduction of biomass in succeeding trophiclevels ( Interactive Figure 3 . 14 ) . For example , if one assumes about a 90 % reduction of biomass for eachsucceeding trophic level , 10 , 000 kg of grass should support 1000 kg of grasshoppers , which in turn support 100kg of toads . The 90 % reduction in biomass is used for illustrative purposes only ; actual field numbers for biomassreduction in nature vary widely . By this logic , however , the biomass of toad eaters such as snakes could be , atmost , only about 10 kg . From this brief exercise , it is apparent that although carnivores do not eat vegetation , agreat deal of vegetation is required to support them . BeginDirections : Drag the slider to reveal a progressive reduction of biomass with increasing trophic level . Interactive Figure 3 . 14 Pyramid of biomass This pyramid is for a hypothetical area of temperate grassland . Based on the biomass at each trophic level , pyramids of biomass generally have a pyramid shape with a large base and progressively smaller areas for eachsucceeding trophic level . ( Note that decomposers are not shown . ) Environmental Connections Unseen Biomass The biomass of producers in an ecosystem — the total mass of their living material — is not limited to theplant stems , leaves , fruits , and seeds that you can see . The below ‐ ground biomass of a plant , its roots andrhizomes ( horizontal stems ) , are also alive and vital to the plant ' s function . In a salt marsh , where thedominant producer is cordgrass , the below ‐ ground biomass consists of a tightly woven system of rhizomesthat anchor the plants and facilitate their spreading . This structure also enables much of the marsh ' s abilityto serve as a buffer against storm impacts . Wetlands researchers are discovering that changes to a marsh ' s below ‐ ground biomass , particularly thosegenerated by heavy , steady nutrient inputs like sewage and fertilizer , can disrupt the marsh ' s protectiveunderground structure .

The ready supply of nutrients causes above ‐ ground biomass to flourish whiletriggering decomposition in underground biomass . Eventually the physical imbalance causes the marshstructure to collapse on itself . Scientists suspect this progression could explain in part the marsh losses atedge areas adjacent to water . A pyramid of energy illustrates the energy content , often expressed as kilocalories per square meter per year , of the biomass of each trophic level in an ecosystem ( Figure 3 . 15 ) . These pyramids always have large energybases and get progressively smaller through succeeding trophic levels . Energy pyramids show that most energydissipates into the environment when going from one trophic level to the next . Less energy reaches eachsuccessive trophic level from the level beneath it because organisms at the lower level use some energy toperform work , and some energy is lost . ( Remember , because of the second law of thermodynamics , no biologicalprocess is ever 100 % efficient . ) Energy pyramids explain why there are so few trophic levels : Food webs are shortbecause of the dramatic reduction in energy content at each trophic level . ( See “ You Can Make a Difference : Plant ‐ Based Diets ” in Chapter 18 for a discussion of how the eating habits of humans relate to food chains andtrophic levels . ) FIGURE 3 . 15 Pyramid of energyThis pyramid indicates how much energy is present in the biomass at each trophic level in a salt marsh inGeorgia and how much is transferred to the next trophic level . Note the substantial loss of usable energy fromone trophic level to the next ; this loss occurs because of the energy used metabolically and given off as heat . ( Note that decomposers are not shown . The 36 , 380 kcal / m2 / year for the producers is gross primary productivity , or GPP , discussed shortly . ) ( AfterJ . M . Teal . Energy flow in the salt marsh ecosystem of Georgia . Ecology , Vol . 43 [ 1962 ] ) . Ecosystem Productivity The gross primary productivity ( GPP ) of an ecosystem is the rate at which energy is captured duringphotosynthesis . ( Gross and net primary productivities are referred to as primary because plants occupy the firsttrophic level in food webs . ) Of course , plants respire to provide energy for their own use , and this acts as a drain on photosynthesis . Energyin plant tissues after cellular respiration has occurred is net primary productivity ( NPP ) . That is , NPP is theamount of biomass found in excess of that broken down by a plant ' s cellular respiration . NPP represents the rateat which this organic matter is actually incorporated into plant tissues for growth . Both GPP and NPP are expressed as energy per unit area per unit time ( kilocalories of energy fixed byphotosynthesis per square meter per year ) or as dry weight ( grams of carbon incorporated into tissue per squaremeter per year ) . Only the energy represented by NPP is available as food for an ecosystem ' s consumers .

Only the energy represented by NPP is available as food for an ecosystem ' s consumers . Consumers use most ofthis energy for cellular respiration to contract muscles ( obtaining food and avoiding predators ) and to maintainand repair cells and tissues . Any energy that remains is used for growth and for the production of young , collectively called secondary productivity . Any environmental factor that limits an ecosystem ' s primaryproductivity — an extended drought , for example — limits secondary productivity by its consumers . Ecosystems differ strikingly in their productivities ( Figure 3 . 16 ) . On land , tropical rainforests have the highestNPP , probably because of their abundant rainfall , warm temperatures , and intense sunlight . Tundra , with itsharsh , cold winters , and deserts , with their lack of precipitation , are the least productive terrestrial ecosystems . Wetlands — swamps , marshes , and estuaries that connect terrestrial and aquatic environments — are extremelyproductive . The most productive aquatic ecosystems are algal beds and coral reefs . Even though the ocean ishome to abundant producers , its vast size ( large volume ) contributes to its low NPP values . A lack of availablenutrient minerals in some open ocean regions makes them extremely unproductive , equivalent to aquaticdeserts .

New York : Macmillan [ 1975 ] ) QuestionWhy do you think the productivity of agricultural land might be lower than the forest nearby ? Human Impact on Net Primary Productivity Humans consume far more of Earth ' s resources than any other of the millions of animal species . PeterVitousek and colleagues at Stanford University calculated in 1986 how much of the global NPP is appropriatedfor the human economy and therefore not transferred to other organisms . When both direct and indirect humanimpacts are accounted for , Vitousek estimated that humans use 32 % of the annual NPP of land ‐ basedecosystems . This is a huge amount considering that we humans represent about 0 . 5 % of the total biomass of allconsumers on Earth . In 2007 , K .

A 2013 update byErb ' s group confirmed the 25 % value for human ‐ appropriated NPP and suggested that measures such asimproved land ‐ use efficiency could keep the value stable . However , the use of biomass for fuel — such as raisingcorn to produce biofuel — increases the human appropriation of NPP , leaving less for the planet ' s otherorganisms . These studies provide us with estimates , not actual values . However , the take ‐ home message is simple : Humanuse of global productivity is competing with other species ' energy needs . Our use of so much of the world ' sproductivity may contribute to the loss of many species , some potentially useful to humans , through extinction . Human consumption of global NPP could become a serious threat to the planet ' s ability to support both itsnonhuman and human occupants . If we want our planet to operate sustainably , we must share terrestrialphotosynthesis products — that is , NPP — with other organisms . Review 1 . What is a food web ? 2 .

Concept Check : Learning Objective 3 . 3 Review of Learning Objectives with Selected Key Terms Define ecology . Ecology is the study of the interactions among organisms and between organisms and their abioticenvironment . Distinguish among the following ecological levels : population , community , ecosystem , landscape , and biosphere . A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area at the same time . Acommunity is a natural association that consists of all the populations of different species that live andinteract within an area at the same time . An ecosystem is a community and its physical environment . Alandscape is a region that includes several interacting ecosystems . The biosphere is the parts of Earth ' satmosphere , ocean , land surface , and soil that contain all living organisms . Define energy , explaining how it is related to work and to heat . Energy is the capacity to do work . Energy can be transformed from one form to another but is oftenmeasured as heat ; the unit of heat is the kilocalorie ( kcal ) . Contrast potential energy and kinetic energy . Potential energy is stored energy ; kinetic energy is energy of motion . Using a bow and arrow as anexample , potential energy is stored in the drawn bow and is converted to kinetic energy as the string isreleased and the arrow speeds toward its target . Distinguish between open and closed systems . In thermodynamics , system refers to a group of atoms , molecules , or objects being studied ; the rest of theuniverse other than the system is known as the surroundings . A closed system is self ‐ contained ; that is , itdoes not exchange energy with its surroundings . In contrast , an open system exchanges energy with itssurroundings . 1 .

All of the choices are correct . State the first and second laws of thermodynamics , discussing the implications of these lawsas they relate to organisms . According to the first law of thermodynamics , energy cannot be created or destroyed , although it canchange from one form to another . According to the second law of thermodynamics , when energy isconverted from one form to another , some of it is degraded into heat , a less usable form that disperses intothe environment . The first law explains why organisms cannot produce energy but must continuously captureit from the surroundings . The second law explains why no process requiring energy is ever 100 % efficient . Summarize the reactions for photosynthesis and cellular respiration , contrasting these twobiological processes . In photosynthesis : In cellular respiration : Plants , algae , and some bacteria capture radiant energy during photosynthesis and incorporate some of itinto chemical energy contained within carbohydrate molecules . All organisms obtain the energy incarbohydrate and other molecules by cellular respiration , in which molecules such as glucose are brokendown , releasing energy . Define energy flow , trophic level , and food web . Energy flow is the passage of energy in a one ‐ way direction through an ecosystem . A trophic level is anorganism ' s position in a food chain , which is determined by its feeding relationships . A food web is arepresentation of the interlocking food chains that connect all organisms in an ecosystem . Summarize how energy flows through a food web , incorporating producers , consumers , anddecomposers in your explanation . Energy flow through an ecosystem is linear , from the sun to producer to consumer to decomposer . Much ofthis energy is converted to less usable heat as the energy moves from one organism to another , as stipulatedin the second law of thermodynamics . Producers are the photosynthetic organisms ( plants , algae , and somebacteria ) that are potential food resources for other organisms . Consumers , which feed on other organisms , are almost exclusively animals . Decomposers feed on the components of dead organisms and organicwastes , degrading them into simple inorganic materials that producers can then use to manufacture moreorganic material .

Human use of global productivity is competing with other species ' energy needs . Critical Thinking and Review Questions 1 .
